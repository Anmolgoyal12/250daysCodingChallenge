Problem statement
Given an array of length N, you need to find and print the sum of all elements of the array.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6
Note for C++:
It is advisable to declare an array with a size that can accommodate all the elements, considering that N has a maximum value of 10^5.
Sample Input :
3
9 8 9
Sample Output :
26

  Program
  #include<iostream>
#define max 1000006
using namespace std;

int main(){
    /* Read input as specified in the question.
     * Print output as specified in the question.
     */
    
    long a[max],s=0,n;
    
            cin>>n;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      cin >> a[i];
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        s=s+a[i];

    } 
    cout<<s;
    return 0;
}
